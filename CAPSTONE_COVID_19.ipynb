        "Although 86% of countries invest local or donor funds in health security, few countries pay for health security gap assessments and action plans out of national budgets. As such, we hypothesize that recovery rates are not only greatly influenced by the six dimensions of health security described in our analysis below, but also by the nutritional access and regional diets.  For example, the Eastern Mediterranean region consumes high level of nigella seeds, pomegrante seeds as well as almonds and pine nuts (categorized as 'tree nuts' in our Fat Supply Quantity data set), which are regionally believed to boost immunity. Perhaps, this boost in immunity could serve as another layer in fighting COVID-19 and result in higher recovery rates.  "

        "We see that the Eastern Mediterranean countries included (Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen) present a range between .076 (Yemen) to 3.82 (UAE) regarding 'Treenuts' composite in diet. This range may be attributed to income per capita. Specifically, the lowest end of spectrum is Yemen, a lower-income country, in contrast to the highest end of spectrum UAE, a high-income country. We would need to do a comparative analysis to see if the same trend occurs with this diet in another region and see if income disproportionally affects the consumption of tree nuts. "
